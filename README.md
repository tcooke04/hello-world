# hello-world
I'm currently learning the fundamentals of informatics in IT. I have been a Nursing Assistant for 20 years and wanted to do something different. My reasoning for going to school for IT is that I want to learn about IT and find employment in IT so I can work from home. 
Working from home would benefit me because I can spend more time with my family.
